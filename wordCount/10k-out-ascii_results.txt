Okay Start over
Okay there was a game in May that was called for curfew
When they finished in August the hits were recorded twice
Once in May once in August
Stan Ross had three hitsin that game
That means that threeof the hits don t count
So you re telling me Stan Ross Mr

As Yahko tried to escapeacross the rope bridge

by the dreaded evil boars
Yahko knew his only hopewas to do the unthinkable
and that was to jumpfar far below

If you look on the back you llsee it s written in Latin

Very old card It s on parchment
Channel changes He s now in his comeback
At what point Peter does the rust come off
I m not sure it does
Remember Jim Palmertried to come back
after he wasin the Hall of Fame
and he kept himselfin better shape than Ross
Why does the media hatethis guy so much
He s a jerk
Because T Rex is the bestin power and performance
Find it at Radio Shack
Radio Shack You ve got questions

Favorite portion of the show the comedy portion
I m gonna say it here
the woman that puts onthe sausage outfit
that races around Miller Park
has got a better chanceof getting a hit than Stan Ross
Audience jeering That s not fair Tom
He s a black athlete
Black athletes age slower
George Foreman didn tknow when to get out
Mike Tyson didn tknow when to get out
Michael Jordan struggled and he was only out two years
This guy hasn t played sinceI was married to my first wife
It just isn t possibleto get out of his day
He s a bad teammate
Stan Ross was a great athlete Stan is all about Stan
The Brewers knewwhat they were getting into
It s a publicity stunt
just like when the White Soxhired that midget
Tom you can t say midget
He s small That guy was smallfor a friggin midget
It s like if the Red Soxthawed out Ted Williams
although he d hit betterthan Stan
Listen Stan s playinglike he s frozen
Stan is embarrassing He s embarrassing me
He s embarrassing him He should give it up
But when an athlete gets to thatpoint he loses all his pride
Yeah you re making me cry I don t think he s embarrassed
I think he s havinga party at his place
got bitches all aroundand counting all his money
I don t think Stan cares
MAN Wrong He s embarrassed
He used to be able to hit cannot hit now
SALLEY Very embarrassing
especially with all the bitcheshe got around

Same reason why you here unlessyou re here for something else
Oh okay

ANNOUNCER Just two weeks ago fans
the Milwaukee Brewersseemed willing
to accepttheir perennial position
in the division cellar
Is it more than a coincidence
that their solid defenseand clutch hitting
started withStan Ross th hit
While Ross was just a spectatorduring their last road trip
T Rex Pennebaker has emergedas the team leader
We ve all witnessed the mountingfrustration for Ross
who has gone hitless
in the first two gamesagainst the Astros
in this his final home stand
You can t help but wonderwhat s going through his mind
as Ross window of opportunity
to join that elite hit club
is about to close and closebefore a nationwide audience
So here we are The stage is set
A re energized team playsfor respectability
while Stan Ross knocks onthe door of baseball greatness
Tonight fanswitness as history unfolds
over nine inningsof Brewers baseball
Last chance to go out thereand get yours
We have a lineup change tonight
In hopes of squeezing outan extra at bat for Ross
he s hitting cleanup rightbehind Rex Pennebaker
MAN ON P A Now batting first baseman number
Stan Ross
ANNOUNCER This big crowdis charged tonight
The right hander Norton oneof the most competitive pitchers
in the league will do everything he can
to avoid being a footnotein baseball history
One game one more hit and he has that magical
Ball
They re on their feet rootingfor Ross to get ahold of one
as Norton gets his sign
Ross puts a good swing on it
It s deep to right fieldand carrying well
Damn

Deal with it
Whistling Mister Softee tune
This guy s slider sucks Come on man

This crowd ripewith anticipation

Ross swings
A sharp ground ballup the middle
Second baseman Gomezwith a diving stop
He scrambles It s gonna be close
He s out
Booing Oh my what a close play
From our angle I thought he was safe
CROWD You re wrong
I m surprised Stan Rossisn t protesting the call
Cheering
That man was safe That man was out
What game are you watching
I called the man out I mwatching the same game you are
We are playing for third place The man was out

Walk him off the field
Get him off my field You were safe
You were safe
You were beautiful Come on tiger

ANNOUNCER So it boils down tothe bottom of the ninth inning
Still scoreless here inthe final game of the season
Mr very likelywill be making

If Pennebaker homers
that s the game and Ross won t get another shot
MAN Go T Come on baby
Come on baby Get on
I ll bring you home Come on get on baby
Just get on
And that ball is crushed
A line driveto deep left center
It s going going
It is off the base of the wall
Pennebaker rounds first heading for second
And he is safewith a ringing double
Oh man
He almost took the batright out of Stan Ross hands
But now Ross is upwith not only a chance
for his th base hitand a call from Cooperstown
but an opportunityto drive in the winning run
and end the Brewers seasonon a high note
MAN baby
All right
Come on
Ball Booing
Pitch to him Let s go man
Get your hit
Ball Pitch to me damn it
Reach out thereand get it then
Reach out and get it
ANNOUNCER Those first twodeliveries way outside
Ross now crowding the plate
balls no strikes
Nothing close from Norton
Booing
I m right here
ANNOUNCER Here we go This is it
the count
This crowd roaring
begging Norton to challengeRoss with a decent pitch
BOCA I could always count onyou to do your thing you know
You re consistent You re always driven
And you re always for yourself
That s why I love you
ANNOUNCER Look at this
Ross lays a sacrifice buntup the first base line
and T Rex isn t stoppingat third
Here s a throw to first base and Ross is out
Here comes the play
The slide the tag He is safe He is safe
The Brewers win
The Brewers win
We re movin
Groovin
Ain t no stopping us now
Groovin
Groovin
CROWD Chanting Stan Stan Stan Stan
STAN Corny enough for you
Well it gets worse
First off now all of a sudden the press loves me
Took em long enough though huh
The Hall of Fame voted me inon the very next ballot
And as you can imagine I hadplenty of people to thank
And old Mo
She decided to move backto Milwaukee after all
I know she saidI d never get serious
but these days I m eventhinkin about gettin married
You know so I can havethat great sex all the time
Chuckles
And hot damn if Boca didn tjust up and move to Boca
I can see him right now helping some lost soul sayin
Do your thing Do your thing
And me I retired again like you probably figured
But I didn t want to go outwithout leavin the fellas
a little somethin to remember me by
Even though I left the game
I couldn t stay too far fromit so I bought me that song
Mister Softee tune plays
Out of the tree of life
I just picked me a plum
STAN And that s the whole story
Like my baby Mo says
It s all about figurin outwho you are
And some of that sjust a matter
of gettin a little olderand acceptin it
And I can deal with that
Just cause I m retireddon t mean I m invisible
In fact I m guessin you veprobably seen my commercial
once or twice yourself
The best is yet to come
And babe won t it be fine
You thinkyou ve seen the sun
But you ain t seen it shine
Wait till the warm up sunderway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you seethat sunshiny day
You ain t seen nothin yet
The best is yet to come
And babe won t it be fine
The best is yet to come
Come the daythat you re mine
Come the day you re mine
I m gonna teach you to fly
We ve only tasted the wine
We re gonna drainthe cup dry
Wait till your charmsare right
For these arms to surround
You thinkyou ve flown before
But you ain t leftthe ground
Wait till you re lockedin my embrace
Wait till I hold you near
Wait till you seethat sunshiny place
Ain t nothin like it here
The best is yet to come
And babe won t it be fine
The best is yet to come
Come the day you re mine
Come the day you re mine
And you re gonna be mine

Bionicle Legends of Metru Nui DVDRip DivX srt
Turaga VAKAMA
Gathered friends
listen again to our legend
of the Bionicle
in the time before time
in the glorious city
of Metru Nui
we believed our noble Toa
would protect us
But they fell one by one
as an unrelenting shadow
sought to enforce
endless sleep
so that he could create
a time of dark order
then awaken the world
as their conqueror
Kreka The last Toa
uh
uh
Huh
Huh
Aah
Turaga VAKAMA
And so Toa Lhikan
delivered the sacred stones
to a chosen Matoran
from each Metru
Fire stone
Toa
Toa Lhikan
Guide the others
with your wisdom
Turaga VAKAMA
in every city s life
there is a period
of great building
where artisan builders
such an Onewa
create wonders
that confirm our faith
in the great spirit
of civilization
TOA LHIKAN Builder
l m counting on your courage
Turaga VAKAMA
This city was not just built
from the construction
of things
but from the collection
of history
My friend Whenua
the archivist
knew this more than most
Don t archive it
Whoa
Turaga VAKAMA
it was an age
when brave Matoran
like Matau
would selflessly test
the latest innovations
with foolhardy courage
Whoa oh
Whoa
uh uh
Aah uh
Don t break it
Turaga VAKAMA But it also
was a time of reason
study observance
and looking into the future
And few looked
further forward
without seeing
what was in plain sight
than dear Nuju
What
Toa Lhikan
Follow the map thinker
Turaga VAKAMA Ahh
it was a time of sharing
remembering
building adventuring
dreaming
But above all
it was the time
of my kind
the time of mask makers
those forr whom the art of
creating great Kanohi Masks
from Kanoka disks
was all that they lived for
Aah
Matoran are vanishing
Deceit lurks
in the shadows
of Metru Nui
Keep it safe
This time
your farewell
will be forever
brother
You lost the right
to call me brother long ago
Look out
lt s the end
of the line Toa
uh
Where do You think
You re going
TOA LHIKAN
Kreka Heads up
Brother
Oh Help me please
Compassion
was always your weakness
brother
Ohh
TO A LHIKAN Save the heart
of Metru Nui
the great spirit
depends on You
Ohh
Time is short
No no Wait
Hurry Vakama
VAKAMA Come back
Aaah
uh
No o o o
uh
lt s all my fault
MAKUTA I must have
the Mask of Time
Oh what is this
Whoa
Huh
Without You we have no Toa
Oh Who will protect us now
l should have done something
You should not
blame yourself Vakama
Uh Turaga Dume
You are a mask maker
not a Toa
l have come
for the Mask of Time
Yes uh well
l am sory Turaga
lt s not yet ready
Great Masks
take time to craft
Penaps You are using
inferior disks
l use the finest quality
available Turaga
Uh only Great Disks
are more pure
but they can only
be retrieved by a Toa
Of course Pity Toa Lhikan
is not here to help
Bring the completed mask
to the coliseum
before the Great Contest
The destiny of Metru Nui
rests in your hands
That s what Toa Lhikan said
Ohh the Toa Suuva
Ohh
Aah
Ohh
Fire spitter
did You wrong turn
You tell me
lt appears we are not alone
Well Toa Lhikan summoned me
Me too
lt appears we have all received
these curious stones
all similar yet each unique
Like us All Matoran
some just more handsome looking
than the rest
Who s ever heard
of a Matoran
getting summoned
to the Great Temple like this
What will be asked of us
We are all just strangers
Ha ha Some stranger
than others
your negativity pollutes
this sanctuary Builder
Save the lessons
for your class teacher
VAKAMA Look
we re here for a reason
Ohh
Ohh
l ve never seen
Toa Lhikan
Whoa
Would You look at that
Faithful Matoran
Metru Nui needs You
A shadow threatens its heart
Prove yourselves worthy Toa
And fear not
The Great Spirit
shall Guide You
in ways
You could not imagine
Hey
Huh Amazing
Am l a Toa
lf we appear
to be Toa heroes
then we are Toa heroes
Now this is a Toa tool Hah
Ha ha ha Always wanted
one of these Hmm
Such perfect balance
A disk launcher
uh Hah
Whoo hoo
Whoo hoo ha ha ha
Whaa daah
Ohh
ONEWA Nice move Matau
Need l remind You
this is about honoring
our responsibility
to the Great Spirit
Onewa s right
Mask maker You saw
Toa Lhikan last right
Well uh
Uh what did he say
we could expect
He told me
to stop the darkness
That l had to save
the heart of Metru Nui
Then the Dark Hunters
took him away
lt was because of me
No
TO A LHIKAN Save
the heart of Metru Nui
Find the great Disks
What s with him Heh heh
All that smelting
must ve cooked his head
l saw it
Metru Nui was destroyed
The Great Kanoka Disks
were headed right for me
Thanks for dream sharing
Vakama
Well according to
ancient legend
one Great Disk is hidden
in each Metru
And finding them
would prove to Turaga Dume
that we are worthy Toa
So we go on
a scavenger hunt
because a fire spitter
stood too long
in front of his forge
Visions can be
a sign of madness yes
Or messages
from the Great Spirit
But as Toa we cannot
afford to ignore them
l concur
Yeah
Then it is agreed
Mm hmm
NOKAMA Each will recover
the great Disk
from our own Metru
and present it to Turaga Dume
He will know what to do
l m doing this for Lhikan
no one else
lt says here the Great Disks
will be found
by seeking the unfamiliar
within the familiar
Turaga VAKAMA And so
whether it was madness
or messages
from the great spirit
that Guided us
we undertook
the greatest scavenger hunt
in the history
of Metru Nui
We werre justly proud
of our new Toa stature
And one by one
in our homelands
we sought out found
and recovered
these great Disks
We never even feared
the consequences
WWWoe hhaaadd bbboooHdd hhoeaaa rtttss
and courage enough
for the whole city
hf You measure a hero
by effort alone
we most certainly
were great Toa
But effort alone
is seldom enough
forr legends
Turaga DUME ON SPEAKER
it is with deep sorrrow
that I must inform You
of the disappearance
of our beloved Toa Lhikan
But with the help
of the Vahhki
order shall be maintained
Trust in me
and soon all your concerns
will be laid to rest
Hmm
lnteresting
Toa
Toa
Hello Metru Nui
l always wanted
to loud shout that
Vakama
Ha ha ha ha
Matoran one day
Toa the next
No wonder You have not yet
completed the Mask of Time
Forgive the delay Turaga
NOKAMA We present You
with the great Kanoka Disks
and pledge ourselves as
the new guardians of Metru Nui
Ah ha Toa must prove themselves
with deeds not simple gifts
Turaga DUME
Matoran of Metru Nui
the Great Spirit has provided us
with six new Toa
who will undoubtedly
demonstrate their worthiness
on this field of honor
Catch this
fire spitter
What a waste
Cross the sea of protodermis
and be honored as Toa
NOKAMA What s going on
What do we do now
We use the mask powers
the Great Spirit gave us
Yeah and just how
do we do that
Follow me This way
NOKAMA

Aaaaah

ONEWA Behind You
Huh
Time to quick run
NOKAMA Aah

Ha ha ha ha
Let us praise these jesters
Perhaps they sought
to entertain us
during this
difficult time
Or are they imposters
No We are Toa
responsible for
Toa Lhikan s demise
No it was them
They took him
Seize them
What
Now what
Nuju hang on
Somebody
uh
NOKAMA Brothers
Vakama The statue

Yes
Haah
Heh heh heh heh

The new Toa must not interfere
with the plan
They are mere Matoran
in Toa armor
As is our duty
we shall not fail
VAKAMA
We ve been betrayed
NOKAMA We ve got
to save the others
To do that we need
to find our mask powers
l agree
But we have
to get out of here
Come on
Huh
What are You waitin for
Ah hah Whoa

Why do l bother
MAKUTA
the Mask of Time
is not yet commpleted
No
But when
the Great Shadow falls
the Vahki will ensure
every Matoran s fate
KONGU But the entire
system could explode
if I reverse the flow
Do it
Then again

NOKAMA
Aaaah Hang o o on

WHENUA

WWWhhoenmn wwwoookkoe uu pbb

Remarkable
Vakama Come on
What Just a moment
Vakama we ve got to go
But the disks
Look
Toa Lhikan s spirit star
Each Toa has one
As long as it burns
in the night sky
Toa Lhikan remains alive
lt is headed toward Po Metru
What about our captured
Toa brothers
We need Toa Lhikan
to stop Turaga Dume
and free the other Toa
And how do You propose
we quick catch a spirit star
Penaps a way has been
revealed rider
Vakama
What are these
Storage containers
but most odd looking
MAKUTA Vakama
The Matoran
They re in danger
NOKAMA What do You see
Nothing sister
Nothing at all
Eh cross wired
Turaga l know You not
your concerns should be with
your own identity not mine
Freedom and escape
are different objectives
but both aren t easily realized
You are stuck in here
with us so
l have freedom even in here
But for escape
Toa mask powers are needed
l doubt we will ever be in touch
with our mask powers
Oh never doubt what
You are capable of
The Great Spirit lives
through us all
Vakama your destiny no longer
lies in sculpting masks
You are a Toa
Ahh l ll never be
a real Toa
l can t even make
a decent mask
l m just a cross wired freak
who has weird dreams
Toa Lhikan You got it wrong
You will
Have faith
Ride s over
Ooh
uh
Stick close
Bad things happen
in the desert
Oh Matau You don t know
what You re talking about
Fine Don t listen to me
teacher
Hello
Hello hello
Guess they all quick sped
Builders do not abandon
their projects
without good reason
Then where is everyone
Over here Toa
No Kreka
Aah A Toa hero
knows no fear
Unh uh
Help Vakama Nokama
There s a Toa down

Hey What about me
Matau hang on
Follow me
Hmm No Get down
Aah
Aah Aah
No
You fool
l was wrong
You were right my brother
Heh lt s amazing
what You can learn
when You re not always
speak teaching
What did You say
l didn t say
Why the mask glowing
Nokama
Whoo Whoo hoo hoo
My mask power
The chief wants to know
why we are allied
with the Dark Hunters
Tell him we re not
We seek a friend who s been
taken by the hunters
We are
free to pass
since we are both against
the hunters who trespass
the beauty of the Herdlands
Heh Beauty Where
And who knew Kikanalo
could think talk
l just thought
they were dumb beasts
Kikanalo still think the same
of tall green Matoran
Hey hey hey hey
l m a Toa
Wait wait Tall Matoran
Ask him if the Dark Hunters
trespassed with a tall Matoran
Yes They take many things to
the Place of Unending Whispers
That must be where
they have Toa Lhikan
They will show us the way
Whoo hoo hoo hoo
Only a great Toa rider
could tame a wild
Kikanalo beast
Ooh uh
lt seems a great
Toa rider just got tamed
uh
Do not rely
on your memory
Look beyond your history
and see what is
Hey l m not a Rahi bat OK

Oh
Soon You ll be ready
For a game of pin the tail
on the ash bear
record keeper Ha ha ha
Uh
l could toil
at this task forever
and still learn nothing
for the future
Today You can learn
that building
the tallest tower
begins with the placement
of a single stone
Build a tower
A thinker would never
lay hands on stone
They re too busy with
their heads in the stars
A Toa s duty is to all Matoran
regardless of village
so You shall help
both your brothers
MATAU Vahki
hundreds of them
NOKAMA That must be
where Toa Lhikan is
What should we do
How do we get in there
l have a plan
Oh
uh
That was a complete
waste of time
Without self discovery
You will never find
your destiny
This is every Toa s duty
to the Great Spirit
This whole thing was
a load of duty if You ask me
Sit down Whenua
Taking orders from a Turaga
was one thing
but from an overgrown
hammer swinger
Sit down
Sit down
Aah
Sit down now

how You did that
Stop

Toa Lhikan will be
forever in your debt
lf they seal us in
how will we get out
NOKAMA Don t wory
We ll find a way
Excellent
Dume s mask has been useful
Now for its final task
The future will be mine

Lorelai I like that
It s my mother s name too
She named me after herself
She was lying in the hospital thinking about how men name boys after themselves all the time you know so why couldn t women

Last week it was Madame Bovary This week it s Moby Dick
But why would you
Because you re nice to look at
and because you ve got unbelievable concentration
What
Last Friday these two guys were tossing around a ball and one guy nailed the other right in the face
I mean it was a mess blood everywhere the nurse came out the place was in chaos his girlfriend was all freaking out and you just sat there and read
I mean you never even looked up I thought I have never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life
I have to meet that girl
Maybe I just didn t look up because I m unbelievably self centered
Maybe but I doubt it
So did I ask if you like cake
Yeah you did
Oh Cause they have really good cake back there
So you were late getting home tonight
Yeah I went to the library
Oh Oh I forgot to tell you we re having dinner with your grandparents tomorrow night
We are
Mmhmm
But it s September
So
So what holiday s in September
Look it s not a holiday thing
It s just dinner okay
Fine sorry
Red meat can kill you Enjoy
So I finished hemming your skirt today
A grunt of acknowledgment might be nice
I don t understand why we re going to dinner tomorrow night
I mean what if I had plans
You didn t even ask me
Well if you had plans I would have known
How
Well you would have told me
I don t tell you everything
I have my own things
Fine you have things
That s right I have things
Hey I had dibs on being the bitch tonight
Just tonight
What the hell is wrong with you
I m not sure I want to go to Chilton
What
The timing is just really bad
The timing is bad
And the bus ride to and from Hartford it s like thirty minutes each way
I can t believe what I m hearing
Plus I don t think we should be spending that money right now
I mean I know Chilton s got to be costing you a lot
Oh you have no idea
All of your money should be going toward buying an inn with Sookie
What about college
What about Harvard
We don t know that I can t get into Harvard if I stay where I am
Okay enough Enough of the crazy talk okay
I appreciate your concern but I have this covered
I still don t want to go
Why
Because I don t
I have to get out of here
We have to pay first
One two three One two three One two three
It s a waltz ladies Susie do you have to tinkle

Oh Rory good I think I found a job for your male friend
What male friend
They need a stock boy at the supermarket
I already talked to Taylor Doose about him
You just send him around tomorrow
Okay thanks
What male friend
Oh he s very cute You have good taste
Hands in the air not in the nose
Oh you re gonna have to walk faster than that
You re gonna have to turn into friggin Flo Jo to get away from me
This is about a boy of course
I can t believe I didn t see it
All this talk about money and bus rides
You got a thing going with a guy and you don t want to leave school
I m going to bed
God I m so dense
That should have been my first thought After all you re me
I m not you
Really
Someone willing to throw important life experiences out the window to be with a guy
It sounds like me to me
Whatever
So who is he
There s no guy
Dark hair romantic eyes
Looks a little dangerous
This conversation is over
Tattoos are good too
I don t want to change schools because of all the reasons I ve already told you a thousand times
If you don t want to believe me that s fine
Goodnight
Does he have a motorcycle
Cause if you re gonna throw your life away he better have a motorcycle

Potatoes could use a little salt though
Excuse me
So Grandpa how s the insurance biz
Oh people die we pay
People crash cars we pay
People lose a foot we pay
Well at least you have your new slogan
And how are things at the motel
The inn They re great
Lorelai s the executive manager now Isn t that wonderful
Speaking of which Christopher called yesterday
Speaking of which How is that a speaking of which
He s doing very well in California His Internet start up goes public next month
This could mean big things for him
Very talented man your father
She knows
He always was a smart one that boy
You must take after him
Speaking of which I m gonna get a Coke Or a knife

I think I m gonna go talk to her
No I ll go
You stay and keep your grandfather company
Lorelai come back to the table
Is this what it s gonna be like every Friday night
I come over and let the two of you attack me
You re being very dramatic
Dramatic Were you at that table just now
Yes I was and I think you took what your father said the wrong way
The wrong way How could I have taken it the wrong way What was open to interpretation
Keep your voice down
No Mother I can t take it anymore
Tonight just seems like a nightmare
You re dripping all over the floor
Why do you pounce on every single thing I say
That s absurd You barely uttered a word all night
That s not true
You said pie
Oh come on
You did All I heard you say was pie
Why would he bring up Christopher
Was that really necessary
He likes Christopher
Isn t that interesting Because as I remember when Christopher got me pregnant Dad didn t like him so much
Oh well please you were sixteen What were we supposed to do throw you a party
We were disappointed The two of you had such bright futures
Yes And by not getting married we got to keep those bright futures
When you get pregnant you get married A child needs a mother and a father
Oh Mom Do you think that Christopher would have his own company right now if we d gotten married
Do you think he would be anything at all
Yes I do Your father would have put him in the insurance business and you d be living a lovely life right now
He didn t want to be in the insurance business and I am living a lovely life right now
That s right far away from us
Oh here we go
You took that girl and completely shut us out of your life
You wanted to control me
You were still a child
I stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink okay
I had to figure out how to live I found a good job
As a maid With all your brains and talent
I worked my way up I run the place now
I built a life on my own with no help from anyone
Yes and think of where you would have been if you d accepted a little help hmm
And where Rory would have been But no you were always too proud to accept anything from anyone
Well I wasn t too proud to come here to you two begging for money for my kid s school was I
No you certainly weren t But you re too proud to let her know where you got it from aren t you
Well fine you have your precious pride and I have my weekly dinners
Isn t that nice We both win
Mom
I m okay I just do I look shorter Cause I feel shorter
Hey how bout I buy you a cup of coffee

So nice dinner at the grandparents house
Oh yeah her dishes have never been cleaner
You and Grandma seemed to have a nice talk
How much did you hear
Not much You know snippets
Snippets
Little snippets
So basically everything
Basically yes
Well the best laid plans
I think it was really brave of you to ask them for money

Poot
Parents our children
are out of control
This is what happens when toilet humor
is allowed to run rampant
That s right
Kenny set himself on fire
because he saw Terrance and Phillip
do it in that dirty movie
We must stop dirty language
from getting to our children s ears
We must go fight
the source of it
But what is the source
Oh that s easy
Times have changed
Our kids are getting worse
They won t obey their parents
They just want
to fart and curse
Should we
blame the government
Or blame society
Or should we blame
the images on TV
No
Blame Canada
Blame Canada
Before their beady
little eyes
Have packed their heads
so full of lies
Blame Canada
Blame Canada
We need to form
a full assault
lt s Canada s fault
Don t blame me
for my son Stan
He saw the darn cartoon
and now he s off to join the Klan
And my boy Eric once had
my picture on his shelf
But now when l see him
he tells me to fuck myself
Well
Blame Canada
Blame Canada
lt seems that everything s gone wrong
since Canada came along
Blame Canada
Blame Canada
They re not even
a real country anyway
My son could ve been a doctor
or a lawyer rich and true
lnstead he burned up
like a piggy on a barbecue
Should we blame the matches
Should we blame the fire
Or the doctors who
allowed him to expire
Heck no
Blame Canada
Blame Canada
With all their hockey
hullabaloo
And that bitch
Anne Murray too
Blame Canada
Shame on Canada
For the smut we must stop
The trash we must smash
The laughter and fun
must all be undone
We must blame them
and cause a fuss
Before somebody
thinks of blaming us
All right you turds
listen up
Your moms are away at a meeting
They put me in charge of you
But you re still grounded
so you re not allowed to have any fun

Announcer
Snacky Smores presents
Let s hear it
for our boys in blue
President Clinton has
called them to action to fight
the evil Canadian scourge
A full scale attack
has been launched on Toronto
after the Canadians
last bombing
which took a horrible toll
on the Arquette family
For security measures
our great American government
is rounding up all citizens
that have any Canadian blood
and putting them into camps
All Canadian American citizens
are to report to one of these
death camps right away
Did l say death camps
l meant happy camps where you
will eat the finest meals
have access to fabulous doctors
and be able to exercise regularly
Meanwhile the war criminals
Terrance and Phillip
are prepped for their execution
Their execution
will take place
during a fabulous U S O show
with special guest celebrities
including
Of course the only way to see the
U S O show is to sign up for the Army
So join the Army and kill
some Canadian scum as we continue
We must rid ourselves
of anything Canadian
Man Down with Canada
Woman Bomb them
Dude don t you like
Terrance and Phillip anymore

Hey yeah

Skating for the gold
He did two salchows
and a triple lutz
While wearing a blindfold
When Brian Boitano

Fighting grizzly bears
He used his magical
fire breath
And saved
the maidens fair

That s what
Brian Boitano d do

my vocabulary
And l just want my mom

Brian Boitano would do

That s what
Brian Boitano d do
Did someone say my name

When Brian Boitano traveled
through time to the year

And saved
the human race again
And when Brian Boitano

From anybody
So let s call
all the kids together
And unite to stop our moms
And we ll save
Terrance and Phillip too
Cause that s what
Brian Boitano d do
And we ll save

Though you die
La Resistance lives on
You may get stabbed in the head
with a dagger or a sword
You may be burned to death

For though you die

Up there

Tomorrow night

DE WERELDBEKER
TIBETAANS KLOOSTERIN BALLINGSCHAP INDIA
Pas op daar heb je de geko
Wat is er bent u ziek
U heeft weer gepakt
Dat heeft geen zin
Waar zet ik dit neer
Is er al nieuws vande twee jongens uit Tibet
Niets U hebt t gisterenpas gevraagd
Ze hadden er al moeten zijn Als er maar niets gebeurd is
De toestand wordt hiermet de dag slechter
Het is nu ook illegaal een fotovan de Dalai Lama te bezitten
Met heel mijn hart stuur ik daarommijn jongste broer
en mijn zoon naar uw klooster
Mogen de kracht van mijn devotieen de zegen van Boeddha
hen veilig over de grenstot bij u brengen
Ik ken de brief
Ik hoop dat alles goed gingaan de grens
We staan machteloos We kunnen niets doen
Zal ik nog een voorspelling vragen
Ja dat is een goed idee
Goed het is een oude gek En hij woont in een stinkhol
Ik heb dit blikje gevonden
Ik dacht je ermee te plezieren
Kun je nog een voorspelling doen
We maken ons zorgenover de twee jongens uit Tibet
Ik heb al n voorspelling gedaan
Nou en Een tweede kan nooit kwaad
Je wilt gewoon een positief antwoord
We hebben nog voldoendezout en thee
Wat we nodig hebben is boter en melk
Breng ook groente mee
En treuzel niet zoals gewoonlijk
Ga nu
Gegroet
Gegroet Welkom
Je bent lang onderweg geweest
We waren bang dat je opgepakt was
We hadden problemen aan de grens
Dat zijn de jongens dus
Ja
Loop even mee met de bagage
We gaan naar de abt Hij verwacht jullie
Buigen
Je pet
Is de reis goed verlopen
Het viel best mee
Je bent nog erg klein
Ga zitten
Ik was erg ongerust over jullie reis
Ik ben blij dat jullie er zijn
En toen
We moesten de Nepalesegrenswacht mijden
Men zegt dat ze Tibetaansevluchtelingen terugsturen
en Tibetaanse vrouwen verkrachten
Neem thee en tsampa
Het is niet zo lekker als in Tibet
Is er nu rijst in Tibet
Ja Chinese rijst
Behalve die vervloekte rijsthebben ze niets fatsoenlijks meegebracht
Een meisje dat Lhamo heette
is omgekomenbij de laatste opstand in Lhasa
Haar ouders schenken het klooster
haar oorringen
Wat droevig
Ga verder
Hun familie wil dat ze allebeimonnik worden
en het boeddhisme bestuderen
De moeder van Nyima is heel arm
Ze gaf dit horloge meeom te verkopen
mocht hij ooit geld nodig hebben
India is het land met de grootstebevolkingsdichtheid ter wereld
Toch maken ze nog plaatsvoor ons Tibetanen
Nu je hier bent
moet je dan ook heel hard studeren
Ja je moet flink studeren naar de abt en de geko luisteren
en de regels gehoorzamen
Ja dat is zo
Hou het horlogeen draag er zorg voor
Het wordt al laat Het is tijd voor jullie wijding
Keer veilig terug
Moet je terug naar Tibet
Ja volgende week help iktwee meisjes de grens over
Het is erg gevaarlijk
De families willen alleendat ze in de omgeving
van de Dalai Lama zijn
en studeren
Je bent nu in goede handen
Prijs je gelukkig
Volg de regels en studeer flink
Wakker worden We gaan
Kom de taxi duwen
We gaan wijden
Je hebt je toevlucht gezochtin de Boeddha
Jij ook
Dit is je boeddhistische naam
Brazili Argentini
Hij trapte de bal keihard het was onvoorstelbaar
Kom hier
Wat zijn jullie van plan
Ik heb jullie daarnet wel gezien
Ga de gewaden wassen
Scheer deze jongensen help hen met hun gewaden
Tussen haakjes Orgyen
Palden deelt jouw kamer
Nyima slaapt bij de jonge monniken
Weet je waarom weons hoofd scheren
Opdat de meisjes onslelijk zouden vinden
Veel zin heeft het niet
Zij zijn ontzettend mooi Het is niet eerlijk
Is het waar dat je je in Tibetmaar n keer in je leven wast
Nee we wassen ons telkensmet nieuwjaar
Hier in lndia wassen we ons elke dag
Je hebt nog veel van ons te leren
Lodo ga je vanavond mee Ben je gek
De geko zal ons straffen
Morgen moet je beslist meegaan
Waarom Dan speelt Frankrijk
Nou en
Frankrijk is het enige landdat Tibet echt steunt
En Amerika
Die zijn doodsbang voor China
Ik heb t niet over politiek Voetballen ze
Dat vraag je alleenomdat je Amerikaanse sponsor
je elke maand dollar stuurt
Speelt lndia
Ze zijn gediskwalificeerd omdat zeeen scheidsrechter omkochten
Zit stil
Ik ga me wassen
Het went wel Het is al jaar de mode
Lach jij maar
Moet je jezelf zien
jouw mode smelt
Zo zit het goed
En deze sturen we terug naar China Nu ben je vrij
Laat hem met rust Kom
Wacht
Lama doe een voorspelling
Zie je niet dat ik bezig ben
Zeg dan een gebed voor Frankrijk
Zijn ze ziek
Morgen hebben ze n voetbalwedstrijd
Dat is zonde van het bidden
Kom we gaan We moeten zenaar hun kamer brengen
Dat is mijn schrijn
Wat is dat allemaal
Deze hier is Ronaldo
Hij is kaalgeschoren
maar hij is geen monnik
Op n avond mag je meenaar n wedstrijd
Jij slaapt hier
Uw zoon en uw broer
zijn veilig aangekomen
Ze zijn allebei gezond en wel
Ze zijn meteen bij hun aankomstin het klooster opgenomen
Ze zijn ook al begonnen
met hun studie
Blijven bidden
Laat t andere zien
Wees tevreden met wat je hebt
Toe nou alsjeblieft
Goed dan Maar alleen kijken Niet aankomen
Vlug De geko
Hee Orgyen
Vooruit opstaan
Is hij vannacht gaan kijken
Ik weet het niet Ik sliep
Vooruit opstaan
Opstaan
Hoe was de wedstrijd vannacht
Fantastisch
De Braziliaan miste maar op zoveel
De bal knalde tegen de paal
Je had het moeten zien
Je hebt n prachtwedstrijd gemist
Jij moet de wierook dragen
Wie ik Schiet op
Boterthee boterthee
Je had Ronaldo moeten zien
Hij miste op n haar
Wat een pech dat je
die wedstrijd gemist hebt
Wie speelde
Brazili stomkop
Waarom zei je er niks van
Vanavond ga ik beslist kijken
En jij Palden Ga je vanavond mee
Wie speelt vanavond
Frankrijk en ltali
Ik ga mee
Ik wed dat ltali wint
In geen honderd jaar Wedden
Waarom niet Waarvoor wedden
Als jij verliest doe jij mijn keukendienst
Afgesproken
Iedereen heeft het gehoord h
Leve Paraguay
Duitsland wint
We vragen een voorspelling
Is dat niet vals
Wat
We willen een voorspelling
Waarvoor
Een voetbalwedstrijd
Wat is dat
Zeg maar gewoon
wie zal winnen Frankrijk of ltali
Is er oorlog
Bah wat stink jij Kom
Wat is er nou weer
Tjonge wat de mensentegenwoordig
allemaal vragen
Maak je geen zorgen Ze zal genezen
Orgyen
De geko slaapt nog niet Waar wacht hij op
Wanneer beginnen ze Zo meteen
We moeten opschieten Langs de kortere weg
kunnen we de fiets niet meenemen
Weet je wel zeker dat tverstandig is
En als ze ons betrappen
Ze betrappen ons niet
Maar als t wel gebeurt
Dan vermoorden ze ons
Waarom spelen ze niet overdag
Het heeft wat te maken met t feit
dat de aarde niet plat is
Maar jij bent n Tibetaan
jij kunt zoiets niet snappen
Schikken jullie de dekens
in de vorm van een lichaam
Kijk hij is gaan slapen
Vooruit
We moeten zeker weten dat hij slaapt
Als we nu niet gaan missen we het volkslied
Nou en Het is dat van Tibet niet
Zou dat ooit kunnen denk je
Kom nou
Waar is die sufferd nou
De afspraak was dat weaan t hek zouden wachten
Hoe ben jij Tibet ooit uit geraakt
Dit is jullie specialiteit
Hou nou op We moeten ervandoor
Wat is er
Er moet zich een spelertussen de keeper
en de tegenstander bevinden
Anders is het offside Buitenspel
Wat is er gebeurd
Kom op
Vooruit Goed zo
Stil wat daar
Mag hij de bal houden
Als de bal overde witte streep gaat
mogen ze hem met de handterug in het spel gooien
Waarom trapt hij zo
Daar staat niemand
Zwijg nou
Waarom Je kent geen Engels
We willen de menigte horen
Vooruit Maldini Kom op
Ja goed zo
Blijf zitten
Gemist
Ja goed zo Mooi
Kom op Zitten had ik gezegd
Laat hem met rust Hij heeft je niks gedaan
Opgedonderd jullie
Nee alstublieft Ik zal stil zijn
Wees nou niet zo streng
Ik Wat heb ik gedaan
Gooi die monniken eruit
Je kunt ons er niet uit zetten
We hebben betaald Het zal me wat
Hier
Ik heb de weddenschap gewonnen
De wedstrijd is nog niet afgelopen
Maar mijn elftal wint
Ze kunnen niet eenseen goeie pass geven
Orgyen is er iemand
Slecht nieuws We zijn erbij
O nee we zijn betrapt
Morgen worden we levend gevild
Wat doe je hier
Naar de maan kijken
Wat doe je nog zo laat buiten
Ik zal het morgentegen de abt moeten zeggen
Je wist je nieuwe vriendvlug op het slechte pad te brengen
Niet te geloven
Gaat hij echt naar de abt
Wees maar niet bang
hij stuurt je niet naar de Chinezen
Wat is er
Wat is er gebeurd
Allemaal je weddenschap verloren
Hou je kop
De boter is bedorven
Wat doen we ermee
Weten ze dat ik op de hoogte ben
Ik denk het niet Ik heb er alleen mee gedreigd
Zeg het hen dan niet
Of we krijgen nooit tucht
Het is moeilijk tucht te houden Vooral nu
Zelfs die nieuwe jongen
Palden was ook al bij hen
Waarom vooral nu
Met de Wereldbeker
Wat is dat
Twee beschaafde landendie vechten om een bal
Dat meen je niet
Het is dus gewelddadig
Soms wel
Komt er ook seks bij kijken
Nee seks is er niet bij
Hoe weet je dat allemaal
Wie heeft dat geschreven
En wat moet dit voorstellen
Gebedsvlaggen zeker
Als jullie nou eens zoveel energiein je studie staken
Wie s nachts nog naar buiten gaat wordt weggestuurd
Jij jij en jij
een maand keukendienst
Jij bent nieuw Deze keer ontsnap je
Begrepen
Mis je je moeder Ja
Mis je je konijn
Wie mis je het hardst
Hallo Aan het dagdromen
Heb je heimwee
Ik heb niks om heimweenaar te hebben
Dit is het enige waar ik om geef
Hier
Wat is dat
Een rubberen snoepje uit Amerika
Ik heb gehoord dat alles in Amerikavan rubber is
Ook hun gezicht en borsten
Kijk maar Zoals hier
Is dat het horloge van je moeder
Laat s zien
Wil je het verkopen
We hebben allemaalde weddenschap verloren
Jij komt ook mooi op tijd Het werk is bijna gedaan
Wat moet je Mag ik wat warm water
Bah zo vies
Je moet hem wassen Ik zal je zeep geven
Je bent hier in lndia niet in Tibet
Als je niks schoonmaakt word je ziek
En dan komenje voorspellingen niet uit
Kom ik doe het wel
Hier
Hier
En ga nou maar We hebben nog een hoop werk
Ben je naar het postkantoor geweest
Waren er brieven voor mij
Nee maar ik heb goed nieuws
Wat
Vanavond spelen ze de finale
Kun je het voetbalniet even vergeten
Maar het is de finale
Als we het nu missen is het voor vier jaar afgelopen
Wat denk je
Ik kook niet graagterwijl jij met voetbal bezig bent
We hebben altwee halve finales gemist
Ja dat is waar
Ik ga vanavond beslist kijken
Als je gaat word je weggestuurd
Weet je niet meerwat de geko gezegd heeft
Heel goed Dat is genoeg voor vandaag
Hee ik heb een idee
We vragen de gekoof we hier mogen kijken
In het klooster bedoel je
Je bent gek Dat laat hij nooit toe
Ze vinden het vooral ergdat we s nachts wegglippen
Het gaat niet om het voetbal
Ben je gek geworden
Bovendien kunnen wedingen beloven
Wat voor dingen
Keukendienstengedurende zes re carnaties
Nee Hard studeren niet spijbelen
Denk na
Wat vind je ervan
Ik weet het niet
In plaats van onze picknickvragen we een tv avond
Da s een goed idee
We gaan het vragen
Wacht even
Waar vinden we een tv toestel
Er is een Indi die er verhuurt
Je hebt t al helemaal uitgekiend
Hoe komen we aan geld
Dat zien we nog wel
Jij blijft hier
Waarom
Wil jij t liever vragen
Jij vraagt t eerst Nee jij Het is jouw idee
Geko
Probeer nog s
Ja wat is er
Goed kom binnen
Heb je al gepraatmet onze nieuwe jongens
Ja
Ik heb een verzoek
Wat ze zeggen komt hierop neer
Als ze een tv toestel vinden
en de toelating krijgen
om te kijken naar deze enewedstrijd naar de finale
dan beloven zeharder te studeren
en zich veel beter te gedragen
Kijk toch wat n ouwe dwaas ik ben
Ik dacht dat onze ballingschapniet zo lang zou duren
Ik was van plan
om deze foto s thuis in ons land
te laten zien
Om iedereen te bewijzen
dat ze in Amerika
gebouwen hebben van welhonderd verdiepingen hoog
Zonder deze foto szouden ze me nooit geloven
En ze zouden me ook nooit gelovenals ik zei dat deze veren
van het achterste van een vogel komen
Kijk zoals je ziet
ben ik altijd klaarom terug te keren naar Tibet
Ik ben nu oud geworden
En ik geloof niet dat ik ooitnog naar Tibet terugkeer
Ik moet mijn gehechtheidaan mijn vaderland opgeven
Denk je dat de jonge monnikenooit zullen weten
wat Tibet echt was
Wat zei je eigenlijk
Wanneer is het gevecht
Gevecht
De twee landendie om de bal vechten
O dat
Rond middernacht denk ik
Wat een vreemd tijdstipom te vechten
En wat winnen ze erbij
Een beker
Een beker
Waarom duurt t zo lang
We hebben nog veel te doenvoor de wedstrijd
Misschien krijgen weniet eens de toelating
Van wie was dit idee
En hoe moet het met het geld
Het geld voor de tv
We vragen geld aan de monniken
Wanneer is de wedstrijd Vanavond
Maak er geen drukte over
Het is goed
Wat hebben ze gezegd Het mag
Echt waar
Ga jij terug naar de keuken
En jullie
Wij houden de collecte Of doe jij het liever
We moeten opschieten
Ga jij bij de anderen langsen kom dan naar mijn kamer
Wat is er
Heb je geld
Nee dus
Waarvoor
Hoeveel geld heb je
Hoeveel heb je er
Hier
Nou jij bent erg vrijgevig
Is dat al wat je hebt
Hoeveel hebben we samen
Zo n tweehonderd
Dat is te weinig
We moeten nog wat gaan vragen
Help je ons de tv te dragen
Is het ver
Neem jij die kant Lodo
Heb ik al gedaan Doe t nog maar eens
We hebben meer geld nodig
Vraag hem wat Hij heeft massa s geld
Geef ons wat geld voor de tv
Ik kijk niet naar zoiets saais
Als je niet betaalt zeg ikdat je slaapt tijdens de gebeden
Monniken horen geen geld te stelen
Monniken horen nietzoveel geld te hebben
Ik heb wat geld nodig
Wat heb je gedaan Het was zeep voor de vaat
Ofje nou een kop ofje hoofd wast wat is het verschil
Wat moet je
Geld
Je hebt nog niet terugbetaaldwat ik je de vorige keer gaf
Alsjeblieft het is belangrijk Het is de finale van de Wereldbeker
Ga weg Ik heb geen geld
Ik weet dat je geld hebt
Hoe weet je dat
De mensen betalen jevoor je voorspellingen
Ik heb je deur op slot gedaan
Hee Doe open
Als je me geen geld leent slik ik de sleutel in
Hoeveel
Honderd
Maak open en ik betaal
Nee Steek het onder de deur
Hier kleine schoft Maak nou open
Je sleutel ouwe sok
Jij bent t
Wat moet dat Het is te weinig
Driehonderd had je gezegd
Voor de Wereldbeker is het duurder
Hoeveel
voor zwart witen voor n kleuren tv
Wat
Kom nou pak die aan
Nee Dat is m n laatste prijs
We hebben maar
Mogen we de rest morgen betalen
Alsjeblieft We hebben niet veel tijd
Wees toch aardig We zijn buren
Dat is onze enige kansom de wedstrijd te zien
Sorry
We gaan terug We bedenken wel wat
Hoe
We gaan roepie halenen komen meteen terug
Hoor eens
over twee uur gaat m n zaak dicht
Langer kan ik niet wachten
Mijn vrouw is alleen thuismet onze zieke dochter
En hoe neem je de schotel mee Op je schouders
Kom
Ik heb een idee Nyima heeft toch een horloge
Dat kunnen we in pand geven
Uitstekend idee
Vraag het hem
Nee Het is van zijn moeder
Het is zijn kostbaarste bezit
Jij bent zijn oom Voor jou doet hij het
Wees maar niet bang Hij krijgt het heus terug
Ik geefje mijn woord
Jij hebt niks betaald vraag jij t
Vooruit doe het
Nyima wacht even
Daar heb je vrienden voor
Jij en Nyima krijgen vanavondde beste plaatsen
We halen de tractor
Gingen we geen tv halen
Schiet nou op
Wacht
O daar zijn jullie
Heb je het geld
Nee maar we hebben weleen horloge
Een horloge
Morgen heb je het geld
Tot zolang hou je het horloge
Werkt het
Natuurlijk Het is Engels
Goed je hebt de tijdtot morgenmiddag
Daarna moet ik het verkopen
Ok neem maar mee
Wij halen de schotelantenne
Wat is er met t horloge gebeurd
Maak je geen zorgen Morgen hebben we het terug
Wie installeert de schotel
Jij natuurlijk
Dat kost dan roepie extra
Dat kan je vergeten
We doen het zelf wel
Wat
Hoe moeten we de schotel richten
Naar het noorden het noorden
Het is niet meer zoals vroeger Tegenwoordig
staan onzejonge monniken blootaan heel wat dingen
waar ouderen zoals ik
nooit van konden dromen
Wees maar niet bangvoor uwjongens
Ik zal ervoor zorgen
dat ze traditioneel worden opgeleid
Ik hoop dat ze het geloofvan Boeddha voortzetten
in harmonie met de moderne tijd
De tv is er
De tv is er
Vlug installeer de schotelop het dak Laat hem niet vallen
Ik zet de schotel op het dak help jij hier beneden
Heb je mijn oom Palden gezien
Heb je mijn oom Palden gezien
Frankrijk wint zeker weten
Dat bestaat niet
Frankrijk wint
Brazili maakt gehakt van ze
Zet hem mooi in het midden
Sluit alles aan
Zet de banken mooi op n rij
Kun je een knoop leggen Palden
Natuurlijk
Trek hem stevig aan dat dit juweeltje niet valt
Een twee drie
Rustig rustig
Kijk uit
Voorzichtig
Palden
zeg tegen Orgyendat de schotel klaar is
Pak de kabel
Kunnen we hem aansluiten
Ja Je krijgt de kabel meteen
Hij is aangesloten Hoe richten we hem
Wat Hoe richten we hem
Naar het noorden denk ik Ja het noorden
Waar is het oosten
Het noorden heeft hij gezegd
Weet ik wel maar waar is het oosten
Waar gaat de zon op
Daar ergens
Hebben die idioten de richting bijna
Palden ontvang je al beelden
Ontvang je al wat
Nee Blijf de schotel draaien
En zo ontvang je nou wat
Palden zeg hen daarboven
te blijven draaien
Naar het noorden
Volgens de lndi
Een lndi moet je nooit n richting vragen
Palden zeg tegen Lodo dat hij
het zuiden probeert
Nyima wil zijn horloge
Nu niet Trouwens een boeddhistmoet niet zo materialistisch zijn
We hebben beeld
Dit is dan de grote avond
Frankrijk tegen Brazili
voor de Wereldbeker
Wat krijgen we nou
De elektriciteit is uitgevallen ezel
Ben je blind
We hebben kaarsen in overvloed
Heeft iemand een zaklamp
Kijk of wij de enigen zijn
Goed nieuws
het hele dorp is donker
Dan is het vlug gemaakt
Raakt dit land ooit ontwikkeld
Misschien wil de leveranciersmeergeld
Wat doen we nou
Ik heb een idee
Geef me een lantaarn
Er was eens een mandie een nachtmerrie had
Een vreselijk monsterkwam op hem af
Vanavond ga ik je opeten
De man was doodsbang
Hij wist zich geen raad
en daarom vroeg hij het monster
Wat moet ik doen
Het monster antwoordde
Hoe moet ik dat weten Het is jouw droom
Wat een saai verhaal
Ik weet wat beters
Een konijn ging drinkenuit een meer Terwijl het dronk
zag het zijn spiegelbeeld Ontsteld rende het weg
Het ontmoette een hond
Ga niet naar het meer
er zit een vreemd wezen
Daarna ontmoetten ze
een hert
een vos
een gans
en een kraanvogel
De pot op met je konijnen
Ga zitten ga zitten
Wat een prachtige goal
Wat krijg je nou
Wat doe je daar boven
Daar zie je niks
Wat doe jij daar beneden Zie je daar
Ik moet geld zien te vindenof Nyima verliest zijn horloge
Dat soort dingen doe je toch altijd
Wat doe je in je kamer
na alle druktedie je hebt gemaakt
Als ik morgen geen geld heb
verkoopt de lndi Nyima z n horloge
Wil je schoenen ruilen voor n horloge
Ik heb nog andere dingen
Laat zien
Is dit mes niet van je moeder
Je bent zo n slechte zakenmandat je n goede monnik wordt
De abt en ik betalen wel
Kunnen we de aarde met leer bekledenom ze zacht te maken
Nee
Wat kunnen we dan doen
Onze voeten met leer bekleden
Ja onze voeten met leer bekleden
is hetzelfde als de aardemet leer bekleden
Op dezelfde wijze zijn vijanden
even grenzeloos als het heelal
Het is onmogelijk alle vijanden
te overwinnen
Maar als je in staat bent
je haat te overwinnen
is dat hetzelfde alsal je vijanden te overwinnen
AI wat onbevredigend is
in deze wereld
alle angst en lijden
die bestaan
zijn het gevolg
van het zich vastklampenaan het ik
Wat moet ik aanvangen
met deze vreselijke demon
Om mezelf te verlossen
van alle kwaad
en om alle anderen
van hun lijden te bevrijden
moet ik mezelf wegschenken
en de anderen liefhebben
zoals ik mezelf liefheb
Als je een probleem kunt oplossen
waarom zou je dan ongelukkig zijn
En als je het niet kunt oplossen
wat haalt het dan uit
ongelukkig te zijn
Hier
Hee wacht
Wacht
Hoe loopt het verhaal af
Welk verhaal
Met het konijn
Hoe denk je
Ik weet het niet Zeg het nou
Wat heeft het einde voor belang
Wat
Wat maakt men zo n drukteover het einde
Dit verhaal is gebaseerdop ware feiten
De abt zag zijn droom in vervulling gaanen is naar Tibet teruggekeerd
Orgyen blijft dromen van de eerstenationale voetbalploeg van Tibet
Heel wat monniken wachten vol spanningop de volgende Wereldbeker
En de Chinezen serverennog altijd rijst in Tibet
